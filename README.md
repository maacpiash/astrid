# [Astro](https://astro.build) + [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) = Astrid

Fine grained reactivity and high performance of Solid.js, combined with groundbraking island architecture and adaptable deployment features (including SSR and Edge) of Astro â€” _it's a match made in heavens!_

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Counter.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Link.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Link.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. The Astro and Solid.js components are in the `src/components/` directory. Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## âš™ Configuration

Astrid comes with Solid.js integration and SSR (with support for ReST API endpoints) configured. Moreover, tools like Prettier, ESLint, and EditorConfig are also included and preconfigured.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
