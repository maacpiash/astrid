## Guideline

### Before you start

Please take a look at the roadmap listed down [here](#Roadmap) before working on any issue or feature. The enhancements that I require for this project are listed here, sort of a _wishlist_. Also look at the list of open [issue(s)](https://github.com/maacpiash/astrid/issues) that might need fixing. You might find find interest in one or two of them.

To work on a new issue or feature, please [email me](mailto:github@maacpiash.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/maacpiash/astrid/issues/new) before forking. It is recommended that you follow one of the templates described [here](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE). After discussion, if the issue is deemed necessary to be addressed, we can start working on it.

To work on the issue, fork this repository as a project under your own GitHub username. You may want to create a new branch, properly named after the issue. This would help you if you would like to work on more issues down the road.

### Time to code

Please follow the [Prettier](../.prettierrc.yml) and [ESLint](../.eslintrc.yml) rules configured in this project. **Code written in violation of the Prettier and ESLint rules will not be merged.**

For commit messages, please follow [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) so that each commit message clearly but concisely describes what was done in the commit. Commit your changes and push them to the branch you opened. Create a new Pull Request when you're done.
